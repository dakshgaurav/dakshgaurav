As a DevOps Engineer with 1.5 years of hands-on experience, I am passionate about creating seamless and efficient workflows that enhance software development and deployment processes. My expertise lies in leveraging tools and technologies like Jenkins, Terraform, AWS, and Linux to automate and optimize infrastructure management.

Throughout my career, I have focused on:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implementing and managing Jenkins pipelines to ensure reliable and fast delivery of code changes.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Utilizing Terraform to provision and manage scalable, secure, and resilient infrastructure in the cloud.

Cloud Services: Working extensively with AWS to design, deploy, and manage cloud-based solutions that meet business requirements.

Automation and Scripting: Writing scripts and automation tools to streamline operations, reduce manual efforts, and enhance system reliability.

Linux Systems Administration: Managing and troubleshooting Linux servers to ensure optimal performance and availability.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to the success of cross-functional teams by bridging the gap between development and operations. My goal is to continue growing my skills and knowledge in DevOps practices, continuously seeking innovative solutions to complex challenges.
